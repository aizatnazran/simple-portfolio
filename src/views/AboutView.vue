      I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a Bachelor of Computer Science
      (Honours) and a strong passion for DevOps. My expertise spans both
      development and operations, integrating practices like Kubernetes,
      Jenkins, and Docker to enhance project efficiency, scalability, and
      automation. Having transitioned from Full Stack Web Development to also
      embracing a DevOps role, I bring a unique blend of skills that optimize
      both development and deployment processes. This dual expertise drives
      innovation and continuous improvement in all my projects.
